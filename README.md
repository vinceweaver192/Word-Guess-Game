# Word-Guess-Game

This game is 2 separate programs (server and client) and includes server to client interaction to keep track of client game data. Both programs have their own GUI and the 
server creates and tracks client threads to allow for more than 1 user playing the game simultaneously. 

The game plays like Hangman, where a player guesses only a letter and has a certain amount of guesses and attempts at guessing the word correctly.
